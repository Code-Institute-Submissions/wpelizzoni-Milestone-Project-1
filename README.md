Twitter's Bootstrap library and Font Awesome icons.  It is uploaded to GitHub 
and deployed using GitHib Pages.

address, credit card information, and selects merchandise.

##Email form - the user click the <Email> button and enters their email

#DEPLOYMENT:

##The project was developed using AWS Cloud9 IDE which is web based.  The 
developer created a local GitHub repository and periodically saved the
project files to it.  At the end of the project, the developer created
a project on GitHub and uploaded the web site to that location.  To test
the project in a deployment, the developer set up GitHub Pages and 
associated the uploaded project with it.

##To run the web site locally, the developer used the cloud 9 Preview function
for each page.  Preview opens a window and displays the image in it.  For 
simplicity, the developer readily changed the size by placing the cursor on
the left side of the simulated screen window and moving it either left or
right.

##When pages were more robust, the developer clicked the upper right icon
which opened a inspect function.  Inspect mode enabled the developer to
test the image on simulated devices with various screen sizes, view the
code and
